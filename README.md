In this assignment, my task is to develop comprehensive APIs for the existing front-end (In-Memory POS system) using Java EE. I am required to integrate relevant specifications such as Servlet, JSON, and JNDI.

My implementation meets the following requirements and adheres to best practices in Java EE development.
                    --> I implement basic CRUD operations.
                    --> I have done fundamental validations.
                    --> I implement error and exception handling.
                    --> I utilize appropriate design patterns with layered architecture.
                    --> I handle CORS errors.
                    --> I use MySQL as the database management system.
                    --> I integrate connection pool with JNDI.
